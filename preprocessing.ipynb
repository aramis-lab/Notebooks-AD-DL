    "\n",
    "Before processing your neuroimaging data, several steps may be needed. These steps can include converting the images to a format readable by neuroimaging software tools (e.g. converting to NIfTI) and organizing your files in a specific way. Several tools will require that your clinical and imaging data follow the **Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)** [(Gorgolewski et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.44). The BIDS standard is based on a file hierarchy rather than on a database management system, thus facilitating its deployment. Thanks to its clear and simple way to describe neuroimaging and behavioral data, it has been easily adopted by the neuroimaging community. Organizing a dataset following the BIDS hierarchy simplifies the execution of neuroimaging software tools. \n",

    "Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have the potential to extract low-to-high level features from raw images, a proper image preprocessing procedure is fundamental to ensure a good classification performance (in particular for Alzheimer's disease (AD) classification where datasets are relatively small).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of deep learning-based classification, image preprocessing procedures often include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bias field correction:** MR images can be corrupted by a low frequency and smooth signal caused by magnetic field inhomogeneities. This bias field induces variations in the intensity of the same tissue in different locations of the image, which deteriorates the performance of image analysis algorithms such as registration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Image registration:** Medical image registration consists of spatially aligning two or more images, either globally (rigid and affine registration) or locally (non-rigid registration), so that voxels in corresponding positions contain comparable information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a **Cropping** of the registered images can be performed to remove the background and to reduce the computing power required when training deep learning models.\n",
