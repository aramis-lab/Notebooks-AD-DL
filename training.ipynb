    "In this notebook the goal is to train a classifier to differentiate the **AD label from the CN label** based on the associated **T1-MR images**. These images were preprocessed according to the section on [preprocessing](./preprocessing.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the literature review done in ([Wen et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1361841520300591)), 4 main paradigms were implemented to train a CNN to perform a classification task between AD and CN labels based on T1-MRI. These paradigms depend of the input given to the network:\n",
    "* 2D slices,\n",
    "* 3D patches,\n",
    "* ROIs (3D patches focused on a region of interest),\n",
    "* 3D images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no consensus in the literature on the architecture of the models that should be used for each input category. Part of the studies reviewed in ([Wen et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1361841520300591)) used custom models, and the others reused architectures that led to good results on natural images (VGGNet, ResNet, GoogleNet, DenseNet...).\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose to find custom architectures by running a search on the main architecture components (more details can be found in section 4.3 of ([Wen et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1361841520300591))). This architecture search was run only on the train + validation sets, and **no test sets were used to choose the best architectures**. This is crucial, as the use of a test set during architecture search can lead to biased, over-optimistic, results.\n",

    "- `preprocessing` corresponds to the preprocessing pipeline whose outputs will be used for training. Current version only supports `t1-linear`. `t1-extensive` will be implemented in next versions of clinicadl.\n",

    "An advantage of the 2D slice-level approach is that existing CNNs which had huge success for natural image classification, e.g. ResNet ([He et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2016.90)) and VGGNet ([Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556)) , can be easily borrowed and used in a transfer learning fashion. Other advantages are the increased number of training samples as many slices can be extracted from a single 3D image, and a lower memory usage compared to using the full MR image as input.This paradigm can be divided into two different frameworks:\n",

    "- **multi-CNN**: one CNN is trained per slice location.\n",
