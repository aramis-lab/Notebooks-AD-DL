    "Previous sections were focusing on pre-built architectures available in ClinicaDL. These architectures were trained and validated on ADNI, and gave similar test results on ADNI, AIBL and OASIS. However, they might not be transferrable to other problems on other datasets using other modalities, and this is why may want to search for new architectures and hyperparameters.\n",

To avoid this pitfall, it is often advise to simplify the problem: focus on a subset of data / classification task that is more tractable than the one that is currently explored. This is the purpose of `clinicadl generate` which creates a set of synthetic, tractable data from real data to check that developed networks are working on this simple case before going further.\n",
